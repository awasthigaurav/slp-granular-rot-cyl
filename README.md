# slp-granular-rot-cyl

A repository of codes and files I used for a Supervised Learning Project in my seventh semester at IIT Bombay on modeling the dynamics of granular particles in a partly-filled rotating cylinder. \
The basic workflow was as follows:
 - LAMMPS simulations
 - Analysis using C++ scripts
 - Final analysis using Python
